## Message search

It is not uncommon to want to search for older conversation content. To search the message history in a room (or in all rooms) for a specific text, the "Search" button is located in the upper right corner of the Element app.

Searching for messages is possible in unencrypted rooms without any problem, since Element
has access to all messages. The situation is different in encrypted rooms. This function
is only possible using the desktop client (see [Clients / Installation]({{< relref
"clients" >}})), because the messages must be cached for the search. The message search
must be explicitly enabled under `Settings` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `Message search`.
Afterwards, searching is also possible in encrypted rooms.
