## Matrix at TU Dresden
Matrix is a free and open, secure, decentralized protocol for real-time communication, also known by the name of one of its clients, Element.

In recent years, the need for supporting digital tools for team collaboration has increased. A central tool is a team chat. According to Wikipedia, a chat refers to "electronic communication by means of written text in real time, usually via the Internet". ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat)). With a messenger team members can make each other aware of current information and especially share links (*hyperlinks* / *links*) for further collaboration (e.g. for finding appointments, collaborative writing, planning events, editing data, code, mind maps,). Due to the lack of a centralized offer so far, many teams at TU Dresden have been looking for their own solutions, some of which are privacy-critical or cannot be linked to other systems.

In order to meet the demand for real-time communication, the open communication protocol Matrix was introduced in a pilot operation at the TU Dresden at the end of 2018, after a comparative analysis of several potential solution options, and presented to the CIO in April 2019. In autumn 2019, the pilot operation was transferred to regular operation. e.g. [digital](https://invidio.xamh.de/AtkA-sE-9uU) [teaching](https://invidio.xamh.de/jEvKdFTKSxU) (Videos by Prof. Lasch) with Matrix in addition to the [OPAL](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal) application.
